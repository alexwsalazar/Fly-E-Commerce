# Cool Employee Tracker

## My Task

In this assignment I built the back end for a e_commerce site by modifying starter code. I configured a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MYSQL database

Because this application wonâ€™t be deployed, I also created a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality.

## User Story

```md
AS A manager at an internet retail company
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies
```


## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/alexwsalazar/Fly-E-Commerce
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd my-project
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the server

```bash
  npm run start
```
